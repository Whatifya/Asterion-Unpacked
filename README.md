# Asterion Unpacked
This is basically a C# Minecraft External Client that works on Lunar and the owner of it (cyrex) was selling the source code for $50 and so I unpacked the latest version so people can use the code. The executable isn't runnable however it is decompilable and you should see its contents. I'm bad at unpacking however if you want me to attempt to unpack something then go to my discord at Whatify#7828.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123612174/219847479-895c5083-5e17-474d-a14a-ba324486d4c1.png)
